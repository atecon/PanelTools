# PanelTools
Collection of (hopefully) useful functions for dealing with panel datasets.


# Public functions

## pcum(const series y)
Compute cumulated value for each panel unit.

Parameters
    y   - series, target series;

Returns
Series with cumulated sum for each cross-sectional unit. NAs are replaced by
zero before cumulating.


## pmode(const series y)
Compute most frequent value for each cross-sectional unit.

Parameters
    y   - series, target series

Returns
Series with most frequent values for each cross-sectional unit. NA values are
ignored. If all values are NA for a unit, a series consisting only NA values is
returned for that unit.


## pfirst(const series y)
Compute first valid value for each panel unit.

Parameters
    y   - series, target series

Returns
Series with the first valid value of "y" for each cross-sectional unit. If no
valid values exists for a unit, NA is returned.


## plast(const series y)
Compute last valid value for each panel unit.

Parameters
    y   - series, target series

Returns
Series with the last valid value of "y" for each cross-sectional unit. If no
valid values exists for a unit, NA is returned.


## pquantile(const series y, const scalar value "p-th quantile")
Compute the p-th quantile for each unit.

Parameters
    y     - series, target series
    value - scalar, p-th quantile; must be in the range 0 < value < 1

Returns
Series with the p-th quantile for each cross-sectional unit. NA values are
ignored. If all values are NA for a unit, a series consisting only NA values is
returned for that unit.


## pxmean(const series y)
Compute mean value of "y" across all units per
time period. Missing values are ignored for computing the mean.

Parameters
    y        - series, target series
Returns
Series with the mean value value across all units per observation. NA values are
completely ignored and are not counted.


## pxfraction(const series y, const scalar value "Value to search",
             const bool fraction[FALSE] "Fraction instead of total number")
Compute the total number of observations of "value" in "y" across all units per
time period. Missing values are completely ignored.

Parameters
    y        - series, target series
    value    - scalar, Value to search in "y"
    fraction - bool, if TRUE (=1) compute the fraction of observations taking the
               value "value", if FALSE (=0, default) compute the number of
               observations instead.

Returns
Series with the respective value across all units per observation. NA values are
completely ignored and are not counted.


## ppolyfit(const series y, const int order[1::])
Fits a polynomial trend of order "order" to the input series "y" using the method of orthogonal polynomials for each cross-sectional unit separately. This function mimics gretl's built-in function polyfit() which works only for time-series data correctly before version 2021c.

Parameters
    y        - series, target series
    order    - integer, Order of the polynomial trend

Returns
Series of fitted values for each unit. In case 'y' has missing values for a
specific unit, for this unit a time-series with NAs is returned.


## panelinfo()
Compute basic information about the panel dimension.

Returns
Nothing.
